# The case for a Universal Object layer

Objects include computational abilities.

There exists the possibility for a universal computing surface.

This has the ability to include all objects comprehensible by man and machine.

Deduplication of storage, and usage.

The necessity of payments:

- This is based on physics, and so all activity costs some energy.
- payments are required to make the system fair by spreading the load amongst those who use it.

Tendency towards duplication:

- because things cost, the vastness of information would make a formidible price to pay.
- Sharing is the best way to keep costs down

Tendency towards fairness

- Universal Awareness would surely lead to fair behaviour.
- Unfair behaviour never seems overt for long.

Innovation at the heart

- Awareness and payment brings innovation
- The primary usage of the system would be for innovation, because awareness of problems leads to their solutions
- the greater the awareness, the greater the solution rate
- the more people can fully comprehend a problem, and the more people at least agree that it is a problem, the greater the change of innovative solutions

The foundation of a general AI

- general AI would surely make a form of object recognition that would be deduplicated across all the running instances of itself.

Probably a blockchain

Holographic in nature

- continuously at fault from nature, and politics
- seamless merging when fault conditions repaired
- necessarily multiview
