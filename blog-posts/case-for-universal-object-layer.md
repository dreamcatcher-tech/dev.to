# The case for a Universal Computing Surface

Universal computing surface.

Serverless Object Compute.

Naturally is hyperconverged. Based on a standard unit of converged computing - the Joule.

Objects include computational abilities.

There exists the possibility for a universal computing surface.

This has the ability to include all objects comprehensible by man and machine.

Deduplication of storage, and usage.

The necessity of payments:

- This is based on physics, and so all activity costs some energy.
- payments are required to make the system fair by spreading the load amongst those who use it.

Tendency towards duplication:

- because things cost, the vastness of information would make a formidible price to pay.
- Sharing is the best way to keep costs down

Tendency towards fairness

- Universal Awareness would surely lead to fair behaviour.
- Unfair behaviour never seems overt for long.

Innovation at the heart

- Awareness and payment brings innovation
- The primary usage of the system would be for innovation, because awareness of problems leads to their solutions
- the greater the awareness, the greater the solution rate
- the more people can fully comprehend a problem, and the more people at least agree that it is a problem, the greater the change of innovative solutions

The foundation of a general AI

- general AI would surely make a form of object recognition that would be deduplicated across all the running instances of itself.

Probably a blockchain

Holographic in nature

- continuously at fault from nature, and politics
- seamless merging when fault conditions repaired
- necessarily multiview

Provides a means of supplying compute resources in bulk, with the side effect that it maintains a crypto currency that has no single point of failure

## Founding Hosting Service

Must support private and public operations. Initially the public operations are controlled by us, but as our software build increases, these operations will become increasingly decentralized.

The revenue from these services is not dependent on being the cheapest provider, as we could never be cheaper than consumers supplying their idle capacity, but rather is dependent on quality of supply on dimensions such as privacy, uptime, support, integration with existing services.

## Storage forever

Reasons why storage can be done forever.

- Graph of AWS S3 storage price decreasing over time.
- Graph of cost of storage due to Moores law.
- Graph of interest rates / money growth

If we charge enough that we can store for 50 years, then we should also be able to earn interest on the unspent money to be able to pay forever.

A backing set of contracts can be set up to provide periodic audit to release the funds over time. This is something required to be run by the core of the top level chain, but the net result is the ability to store forever for a fixed fee. Destroying a chain releases the joule energy stored within because the joule is not fully spent.

Then, people can provide secondary services that sell joules of short lived storage, by purchasing the full price, and then renting to the initiators for a profit. This too could be supplied by the core.

Serverless for blockchains. Universal serverless computer.
