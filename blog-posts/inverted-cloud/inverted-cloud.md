"AMD Silicon" covers wide range too:

1. circuit designers
1. silicon fab
1. supply chain

Our applications must be easily portable to this mode of operation

Need to move to open silicon, with trusted fabs

If cloud@home then the workload is rapidly relocatable, and so the customer may
choose to run some base load on prem, have other load on cloud@home, and sell
their spare capacity on cloud@home

cloud@home makes use of idle resources, and shares yours out too. you can have
enough resiliency for standalone operation in a disaster, but can rent this
capacity out when not in use

cloud configurations
