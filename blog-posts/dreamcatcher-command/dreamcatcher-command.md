We support a higher entity - dreamcatcher command. These are the ideals that command strives for.

DRECMD is an oracle, and causes side effects in an otherwise deterministic system.

This idea arose from a group of mathematicians based at CERN and was developed initially in a loose way. The idea was then further developed by that group into the concepts behind DC. The current codebase brings together these ideas. This is one implementation of those concepts; there may be better ways to do this - this is version one and may well be replaced. The concepts however are the important part.
