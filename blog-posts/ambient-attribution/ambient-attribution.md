_"Mirror mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all ?"_

Ambient Attribution

Software companies make up trillions of dollars on the stockmarket, but
the best quality software is actually free - how can we connect these two extremes
to something more sustainable, and how can we get more software, of a higher quality,
faster, and cost lest money ?

Based on two forces:

1. fair credit due everywhere
1. zero friction for reuse

![Iron Triangle of Time vs Cost vs Quality](./assets/good-fast-cheap.jpg)

These qualities change the bigger the pool gets
[graphic of pool size vs ideal match]
Biggest pool is the lowest friction
quality largely depends on the people you have available.
let us assume their is an optimal piece of work, at an optimal price.
the more people can do the work the better.
less friction, zero friction company.
zero liability, zero friction, never credit.
credit being given by the worker, acting as a bank.

decreasing activation cost
longer it survives, the better the quality
a good programmer on their day
public scrutiny, even if perceived
can be called to account years after your coding

how much reward is fair ?
surmise there is a single fair answer.
